\begin{frame}{Multiple imputation}

\begin{block}{General approach}
\bi
    \myitem For each missingness pattern, a model is built to use the available covariates to estimate the missing covariates. 
    \myitem Random samples are taken from the predictive distribution to create multiple ``complete'' datasets.
    \myitem Typically, 10-15 datasets is seen as being sufficient.
    \myitem Coefficient and SE estimates are combined across datasets.
