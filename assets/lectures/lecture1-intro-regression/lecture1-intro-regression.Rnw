\begin{frame}{What is regression?}

[Now, more formally...]

\vspace{2em}


"...to understand as far as possible with the available data how the conditional distribution of the response $y$ varies across subpopulations  determined by the possible values of the predictor or predictors." -- Cook and Weisberg (1999)

\vspace{2em}

Good overview \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis}{on Wikipedia}.

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{What is regression?}

\bi
        \myitem The goal is to learn about the relationship between a covariate (predictor) of interest and an outcome of interest.
	\bi
		\myitem Focus on prediction
		\myitem Focus on description
	\ei
	\myitem Regression is an exercise in inferential statistics: we are drawing evidence and conclusions from data about ``noisy'' systems.

\begin{frame}{What we want in regression}

Given some data $y, x_1, x_2, \ldots x_p$, we are interesting finding a likely value for $y$ given the value of predictors $x  \equiv x_1, x_2, \ldots x_p$.
\bi
	\myitem Often, but not always, $y$ is continuous. (Called outcome, response, ``dependent variable").
	\myitem The $x$'s can be continuous, binary, categorical. (Called predictor, covariate, ``independent variable").
	\myitem We want $\mathbb E(y | x) = f(x)$; we observe $y = f(x) + \epsilon$.
\ei

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Regression model}

The process of using data to describe the relationship between outcomes and predictors is called modeling.
\bi
	\myitem Models are models, not reality.
	\myitem ``All models are wrong, but some are useful."
	\myitem Introduce structure to $f(x)$ to make the problem of estimation easier (this also introduces elements not found in the data, including judgement calls about important features and assumptions about the world).
	\myitem We largely focus on {\em parametric models} $f(x) = f(x; \beta)$ and worry about estimating $\beta$.
\ei

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Linear Regression Models}

A linear regression model is a particular type of parametric regression.
\bi
        \myitem Assume $f(x; \beta) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots$
	\myitem Focus is on $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots$
	\myitem ``Linear" refers to the $\beta$'s, not the $x$'s: 
	\bi
		\myitem $f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2$ is a linear model
		\myitem $f(x) = \beta_0 + x^{\beta_1}$ is not
		%\myitem $f^{*}(x) = \beta_0^{*} + \beta_1 x^{*}$
	\ei
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Why is linear regression so popular?}

\bi
	\myitem Easy to implement
	\myitem Lots of theory
	\myitem Straightforward interpretations
	\myitem Surprisingly flexible
	\myitem Good approximation in many cases
\ei

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{What do we need to assume?}


\begin{block}{Typical assumptions for a SLR model}
\bi
        \myitem A1: The model: e.g.  $y_i = f(x_i; \beta) +\epsilon_i= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \epsilon_i$
	\myitem A2: Unbiased errors: $\mathbb E[\epsilon_i|x_i]  = \mathbb E[\epsilon_i] = 0$   
        \myitem A3: Uncorrelated errors: $cov(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j)=0$ for $i\neq j$.
	\myitem A4: Constant variance: $ Var[y_i|x_i] = \sigma^2$
	\myitem A5: Probability distribution: e.g. $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$.
        \myitem A6: Representative sampling: generalize to population.
\ei
\end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Things to come}

\bi
	\myitem Where do estimates $\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1$ come from?
	\myitem How do we draw inference about these estimates?
	\myitem What about more complex models?
\ei
