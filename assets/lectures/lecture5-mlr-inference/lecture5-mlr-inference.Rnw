\begin{frame}{Least squares}

As in simple linear regression, we want to find the $\bbeta$ that minimizes the residual sum of squares.
$$RSS(\bbeta) = \sum_i \epsilon_i ^2 = \sum_i (\hat y_i - y)^2$$

99 observations on patients who have sought treatment for the relief of respiratory disease symptoms.

The variables are:
\bi
    \myitem {\tt disease} measure of disease severity (larger values indicates more serious condition).
    \myitem {\tt education} highest grade completed
    \myitem {\tt crowding} measure of crowding of living quarters (larger values indicate more crowding)
    \myitem {\tt airqual} measure of air quality at place of residence (larger number indicates poorer quality)
    \myitem {\tt nutrition} nutritional status (larger number indicates better nutrition)
    \myitem {\tt smoking} smoking status (1 if smoker, 0 if non-smoker)

\begin{frame}{Least squares estimates: identifiability issues}

\begin{block}{If two of your variables are identical, or simple transformations of one another, least squares won't work}
\bi
    \myitem This means that there will be an infinite number of mathematically equivalent least squares solutions.
    \myitem In practice, true {\bf non-identifiability} (there really are infinite solutions) is rare.
	\myitem Can happen if $\bX$ is not of full rank, i.e. the columns of $\bX$ are linearly dependent (for example, including weight in Kg and lb as predictors)
	\myitem Can happen if there are fewer data points than terms in $\bX$: $n < p$ (having 100 predictors and only 50 observations)
    \myitem More common, and perhaps more dangerous, is {\bf collinearity}.
\ei

\begin{frame}{Infinite solutions}

Suppose I fit a model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \epsilon_i$.
\bi
	\myitem I have estimates $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 2$
	\myitem I put in a new variable $x_2 = x_1$
	\myitem My new model is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \epsilon_i$
	\myitem Possible least squares estimates that are equivalent to my first model:

		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 0, \hat{\beta}_2 = 2$

\begin{frame}{Non-identifiablity: causes and solutions}

\bi
	\myitem Often due to data coding errors (variable duplication, scale changes)
	\myitem Pretty easy to detect and resolve
	\myitem Can be addressed using {\it penalties} (might come up much later)
	\myitem A bigger problem is near-unidentifiability (collinearity)
\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Diagnosing collinearity}

\bi
	\myitem Arises when variables are highly correlated, but not exact duplicates
	\myitem Commonly arises in data (perfect correlation is usually there by mistake)
	\myitem Might exist between several variables, i.e. a linear combination of several variables exists in the data
	\myitem A variety of tools exist (correlation analyses, multiple $R^2$, eigen decompositions)

\begin{frame}{Effects of collinearity}

Suppose I fit a model $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \epsilon_i$.
\bi
	\myitem I have estimates $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 2$
	\myitem I put in a new variable $x_2 = x_1 + error$, where $error$ is pretty small
	\myitem My new model is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \epsilon_i$
	\myitem Possible least squares estimates that are nearly equivalent to my first model:

		\item $\hat{\beta}_0 = 1, \hat{\beta}_1= 2, \hat{\beta}_2 = 0$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Effects of collinearity}

\bi
	\myitem Collinearity results in a ``flat" RSS

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Using Variance Inflation Factors: lung data}

\begin{block}{VIFs find variables that are highly related.}

The VIF for the $k^{th}$ predictor in your model is
$$ VIF_k = \frac{1}{1-R^2_k} $$
where $R^2_k$ is the $R^2$ from the model with $X_k$ as the response and all other $X$ variables as the predictors.

<<lungMLRVIF, tidy=FALSE>>=
car::vif(mlr5)
car::vif(mlr6)
@

Rule of thumb is that if any $VIF_k$ > 10, then you should be concerned about collinearity.

\end{block}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Some take away messages}

\bi
    \myitem Collinearity can (and does) happen, so be careful
	\myitem Often contributes to the problem of variable selection, which we'll touch on later

Different answers to these questions will yield different final models.

\begin{frame}{Model selection: realities}

\centering {\em All models are wrong. Some are more useful than others.} \\ - George Box


\bi
	\myitem In practice, issues with sample size, collinearity, and available predictors are real problems.
	\myitem There is not a single best algorithm for model selection! It pretty much always requires thoughful reasoning and knowledge about the data at hand. 
	\myitem When in doubt (unless you are specifically ``data mining''), err on the side creating a process that does not require choices being made (by you or the computer) about which covariates to include.
\ei
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Basic ideas for model selection}

\begin{block}{For association studies, when your sample size is large}
\bi
        \myitem Include key covariates of interest.
        \myitem Include covariates needed because they might be confounders.
        \myitem Include covariates that your colleagues/reviewers/collaborators will demand be included for face validity.
        \myitem Do NOT go on a fishing expedition for significant results!
        \myitem Do NOT use ``stepwise selection'' methods!
        \myitem Subject the selected model to model checking/diagnostics, possibly adjust model structure (i.e. include non-linear relationships with covariates) as needed.
\ei
\end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Basic ideas for model selection}

\begin{block}{For association studies, when your sample size is small}
\bi
        \myitem Same as above, but may need to be more frugal with how many predictors you include.
        \myitem Rule of thumb for multiple linear regression is to have at least 15 observations for each covariate you include in your model.

Analyze the NHANES dataset. Create a parsimonious model with the outcome variable of cholesterol ({\tt chol}) that estimates relationships with other variables in the dataset. Justify your choices of which covariates you included using some basic knowledge about what factors might impact cholesterol levels.
